/*
Tables

Tables show tabular data in columns and rows.

### Accessibility
Simple tables can have two levels of headers. Each header cell should have scope="col" or scope="row".
Complex tables are tables with more than two levels of headers. Each header should be given a unique id and each data cell should have a headers attribute with each related header cellâ€™s id listed.
When adding a title to a table, include it in a <caption> tag inside of the <table> element.
### Usability
#### When to use
- When you need tabular information, such as statistical data.
#### When to consider something else
- Depending on the type of content, consider using other presentation formats such as definition lists or hierarchical lists.
#### Guidance
- Tables are great at displaying tabular data. Minimal visual styling helps surface this information more easily.
